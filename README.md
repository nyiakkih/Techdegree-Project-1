A Number Guessing Game

This project is a number guessing game implemented in Python. The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, providing feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number. The game keeps track of the player's score (number of attempts) and offers the option to play again or view statistics such as the mean, median, and mode of their previous attempts.
